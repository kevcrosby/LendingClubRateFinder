# InterestRateFinder

This machine learning application uses a selection of inputs and outputs an expected interest rate based on historical data. What kind of rate will you get?

 ### Configuration

Data was sourced from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending and investing matchmaker, 2017 data of all accepted loans. This 400,000+ entry data set was sent through a neural network to develop a strong and statistically significant machine learning model. Input data from our front end application is fed through our encoding parameters and tested against the model. This predictive output is visualized onto our Rate Finding Tachometer guage.
